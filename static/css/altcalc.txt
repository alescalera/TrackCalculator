I created the altitude performance conversion calculator after completing my dissertation project titled: "Evaluating the effect of competition elevation and residential elevation on endurance race performance: a prediction model". This was a collaboration with the NCAA and DirectAthletics using the TFRRS database. I combined the indoor track and field results database with geographical survey data to establish competition elevations. By observing the performance changes of each athlete within a given NCAA indoor track season I was able to model the percent change from sea level (1-150m) for each event (800m-5,000m) for males and females and extrapolate the pattern to longer events using physiological principals.
