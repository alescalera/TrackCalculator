My name is Al Escalera. I have a PhD in Human Performance with a major in Exercise Physiology and concentration in Sports Data Analytics from Indiana Univerisity, Bloomington. I am an avid runner and competed at Indiana State University in XC and Track where I received my MS and BS in Exercise Science. In the past I have been interested in physiological assessment, monitoring, and performance prediction of endurance athletes. However, I have really enjoyed my journey into data science and software/web development as it allows me to answer questions traditional experiments cannot accomplish and be able to share results with a wider audience. My biggest interest moving forward is prediction modeling using big data sets.
