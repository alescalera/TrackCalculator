My name is Albaro Escalera. I have a PhD in Human Performance with a major in Exercise Physiology and concentration in Sports Data Analytics with a Data Science minor from Indiana Univerisity, Bloomington. I am an avid runner and competed at Indiana State University in XC and Track where I received my MS and BS in Exercise Science. I am primarily interested in athlete assessment, monitoring, and performance prediction of endurance athletes professionally, but have really enjoyed my journey into data science and software/web development as it allows me to do projects traditional experiments cannot do and I can help a wider audience. I recently moved to South Lake Tahoe, CA and am looking for my next adventure. Please reach out to me with opportunities and ideas for my next project!
